  <h1>Big Ideas</h1>

  <p>[Big Idea 1] My written notes for Big Idea 1: there are a few topics that are crucial when it comes to creative development like collabration, program function and purpose, program design and development, identifying and correcting errors.</p>

  <p>[1.1] Collabration plays an important role when it comes to efficieny, it makes the process or building or coding much simpler, quicker and fun. Mistakes are much swiftly spotted therefore fixed sooner. A part of collabration is computing innovations and what this means id innovations that use programs as a important part o their functions. A physical example of this would be self driving cars, and a non physical example would be phone applications. For devellopers information interchange is very crucial, that is why often t,mes they will have video game testers to check the product.</p>

  <p>[1.2] Program function and purpose, all programs run on inputs and oututs, inputs are the information taken, mostly by the person behind the screen and outputs are what comes out or is displayed when the input undergoes the code the program has.</p>

  <p>[1.3] Program design and development, before coding programmers brainstorm and decide what problem they're trying to solve, what the program will need to do and what it will need to do this, then they design the and improve it if needed. Programmars collect data and feedback from users or hire game/program testers, that conduct interviews and they observe the program themselves to see if they can spot any mistakes. Afterwards, they documet how this proccess wenr and how the program works, so how it was developed, why they choose this coding language to use and etc.</p>

  <p>[1.4] Identifying and correcting errors, there are quite a few types of errors like, logic error, syntax error, run-time error and overflow error. Ways to avoid these are to test various diffrent inputs to see if the output stand correct, using debuggers to get rid of mistakes, hand-tracing.</p>
